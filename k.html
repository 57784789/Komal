        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I am Vandana Patidar pursuing my studies in B.Tech CSE-AI at Mandsaur University. I am passionate about learning and strive for excellence in my academics.<br> I am an eager and ambitious first-year student in the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) department, embarking on a journey to explore the dynamic world of technology and computer science. Enrolled in the Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) CSE program at Mandsaur University, I'm excited to embrace the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.<br>

Although in the early stages of my academic career, I am already captivated by the possibilities within CSE. With a keen interest in coding, problem-solving, and emerging technologies, I am driven to build a solid foundation in programming, algorithms, and data structures. I am actively seeking out opportunities to engage in coding projects, join relevant student organizations, and participate in hackathons to further develop my skills.<br>

As I begin this exciting chapter of my academic journey, I am looking forward to gaining knowledge, connecting with like-minded peers, and exploring the vast horizons of the CSE field. I'm open to learning, collaboration, and contributing my energy and enthusiasm to the ever-evolving world of technology.</p>
